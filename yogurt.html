			<p>Aside from offering a delicious product, <a href="http://www.nomadic-dairy.com/">Nomadic</a> solved several potential pain points for the consumer. First, the top portion containing the oats detaches and serves as a bowl. It also contains a small spoon. The consumer simply pours the yogurt into the bowl and that's it. The consumer does not need anything else in order to enjoy the product. Nomadic thought about how and when people are likely to consume yogurt and anticipated needs that its competitors did not. </p>
