			<h1>Clark combination wallet and money clip by Bregga</h1>

			<p>Card wallets sometimes don't leave enough room for notes. Why should they? They're card wallets. However, <a href="http://bregga.com/products/clark">Bregga</a> designed a card wallet that also functions as a money clip. It is made of soft, high quality leather with a button closure that can be opened and closed with one hand. The outer pocket has a small opening to help push the cards out if you are using one hand. The space between the two pockets holds the bank notes. The customer can personalise the wallet by picking the colour of the leather and stitching and even adding a monogram to the front. </p>
